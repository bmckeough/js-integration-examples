# Local Storage - [Demo](https://ellie-app.com/8yYddD6HRYJa1)

This is a minimal example of how to use `localStorage` through ports.

It remembers user data across sessions. This data may be lost if the user clears their cookies, so it is safest to think of this as a **cache** rather than normal storage.

Anyway, the important code lives in `src/Main.elm` and in `index.html` with comments!


## Building Locally

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elm-community/js-integration-examples.git
cd js-integration-examples/localStorage

elm make src/Main.elm --output=elm.js
open index.html
```

Some terminals may not have an `open` command, in which case you should open the index.html file in your browser another way.
