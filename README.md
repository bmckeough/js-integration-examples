# Using JS within Elm

Not all browser APIs are covered by an official package yet, and sometimes you want to embed JS widgets directly in your Elm application.

This repo has examples of how you can do that in Elm with [flags](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/flags.html), [ports](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/ports.html), and [custom elements](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/custom_elements.html).

If you are evaluating using Elm in your company, definitely browse through the examples here to get familiar with ports and custom elements to make sure these interop mechanisms will fully meet your needs. It may be safest to circle back to Elm later if not!
